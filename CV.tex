{\textbf{The Valuation Effects of Trade}\hfill{2020}}\\\textit{Job Market Paper}\\
{This paper estimates the cash flow effects of currency mismatches generated by foreign-priced operations of French manufacturers. I find that the value of transactions invoiced in foreign currencies is twice as sensitive to exchange rates as the value of transactions invoiced in the domestic currency. I aggregate pricing choices to the firm level to build a
shift-share measure of invoice currency mismatch. My measure outperforms any trade-weighted effective exchange rate index at explaining cash flows of trading firms. However, virtually all investment and payroll sensitivity to exchange rates due to invoice currency mismatch come from small domestic-oriented firms. These results show how large trade value sensitivities to currency fluctuations coexist with the evidence of disconnect between exchange rates and real macroeconomic fundamentals. The real macroeconomic effects are limited because large traders are liquid and small exporters partially hedge their dollar-priced exports with dollar-priced imports.}

\textbf{The Effects of Fiscal Consolidations: Theory and Evidence}\hfill2018\\
\textit{with Alberto Alesina, Carlo Favero, Francesco Giavazzi, Matteo Paradisi}\\
{We investigate the macroeconomic effects of fiscal consolidations based upon government spending cuts, transfers cuts and tax hikes. We extend a narrative dataset of fiscal consolidations, with details on over 3500 measures for 16 OECD countries. We show that government spending cuts and cuts in transfers are 	much less harmful than tax hikes, despite the fact that non-distortionary transfers are not classified as spending. Standard New Keynesian models robustly match our results when fiscal shocks are persistent. 	Wealth effects on aggregate demand mitigate the impact of a persistent spending cut. Static distortions caused by persistent tax hikes cause larger shifts in aggregate supply under sticky prices.}
